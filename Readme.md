# Infra setup for Python India.

Setup configurations for Python India.

## Setup
1. Copy the pillar files from `/opt/magudi/pillar` from `/opt/pillar` in the PyCon India server and populate it with all the necessary configuration details. This has to be done only for the first time.

2. Checkout `provision` file to see a normal run. It might be a good idea to add that file to your path and call it each time some updates need to be done.
